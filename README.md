## Sources and Inspirations 

* '7 Habits and Synergies' of Pairprogramming are to be found in 'Pairprogramming Illuminated'. This book sparked the idea to create a workshop around the topic. Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler did an awesome job. The book is out of print these days. Trent University was so nice to pput it on archive.org [link](https://archive.org/details/pairprogrammingi0000will)
* The Pair draw exercise is credited to [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com/)

## Why is this free

Trainers don't hand out their material normall as freely. There are multiple angles to it. 

1. I want participants to have as much access to all material there is. No spurprise agenda, transparence about the training material. Don't want to come to the workshop? Cool. Spend a day reading the book. 
2. This is not a real business for me. It makes no sense to build 'own ip'. Here and there people call and want me to just hold the workshop and I make it happen if my schedule allows, but I am not here to create a market. 
3. XP in general has a very open communiy and sucessfully ditched 'selling it self' in forms of certifications, non technical coaches etc. So why start now. 
4. I don't have much time to keep it up to date in  a way that would make it 'IP'.
