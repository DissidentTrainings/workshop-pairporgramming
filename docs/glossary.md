### Pair Programming

A software development technique where two programmers work at one computer, with one coding ("driver") and the other reviewing and guiding ("navigator"). This approach improves code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration.

### Promiscuous Pairing

A form of pair programming where team members frequently change partners to increase exposure to diverse perspectives and skills. This method helps distribute knowledge across the team more evenly.

### Driver/Navigator

Roles in pair programming; the driver writes the code, while the navigator reviews the code, offers feedback, and guides the approach. Regular switching of roles enhances understanding and engagement in the task.

### Back of the Room Training

A learner-centered approach where the instructor acts as a facilitator rather than a lecturer, encouraging participants to engage and learn through activities. This method fosters better retention and practical understanding.

### Law of Two Feet

A rule in unconference-style workshops allowing participants to move freely to discussions or activities that interest them most. It empowers participants to take responsibility for their learning.

### Grow and Glow Game

A feedback activity where participants share constructive ("grow") and positive ("glow") feedback. This structured approach helps 
participants improve while highlighting their strengths.

### Pair Draw

A simulated activity that introduces participants to pair programming by having two people collaboratively draw, taking turns as "driver" and "navigator." It gives participants a hands-on feel for collaborative problem-solving.

### Shu-Ha-Ri

Shu-Ha-Ri describes the stages of mastery in learning, starting with learning the basics (Shu), then innovating (Ha), and finally transcending rules to develop personal style (Ri). This concept is used in martial arts, programming, and skill development.

### Extraversion/Introversion

Two personality traits describing one's preference for social interaction: extraverts seek stimulation from outside, while introverts draw energy from solitude or smaller social settings. This distinction influences how individuals approach team work and pairing.

### Synergies in Pair Programming

Synergies are collaborative effects that emerge during pair programming, such as trust, learning, and courage. They help pairs achieve more together than they might individually.

### Pair Pressure

A form of constructive pressure in pair programming that encourages each partner to perform their best due to the presence of a peer. It can help maintain focus and improve quality.

### Pair Negotiation

The process of discussing and deciding approaches during pair programming, allowing both partners to share insights and choose the best path forward.

### Pair Courage

The mutual encouragement pairs provide to take on challenging tasks they might avoid alone. Pair courage often leads to bolder decisions and more innovative problem-solving.

### Pair Reviews

The continuous feedback one partner provides to the other during programming, leading to immediate corrections and improvements in code quality.

### Pair Debugging

Working together to identify and solve coding errors, which benefits from both partners' perspectives and reduces the time needed to find and fix bugs.

### Pair Learning

Knowledge transfer that happens organically in pair programming, where partners share skills, techniques, and insights while working on tasks.

### Pair Trust

The foundation of a successful pairing relationship, where both partners feel comfortable and open, enhancing collaboration and shared ownership of tasks.

### Seven Habits of Effective Pair Programmers

Seven practices that enhance pair programming success, including good communication, humility, and balanced assertiveness. Following these habits helps create an effective and productive pairing experience.

### Myth or Fact Game

A group activity where statements about pair programming are evaluated as myths or facts. This game reinforces understanding of concepts through debate and clarification.

### Pairing-Workspaces

Dedicated areas where teams can work on pair programming with ergonomic setups, dual screens, and enough space for smooth collaboration. Proper setups reduce distractions and boost productivity.

### Pairing-Stair

A visualization tool to track pairs and their activities over time. It ensures structured rotation and keeps everyone engaged.

### Commit

A command in version control to save changes to a project’s repository, marking a milestone. Commits make code changes traceable and collaborative.

### Switch Times

Scheduled intervals during which the driver and navigator roles switch in pair programming. Regular switching ensures balanced participation and shared understanding.

### Hinge Pairing

A pairing technique where pairs switch frequently but continue working on the same project or task, allowing knowledge to circulate across the team.

### Silent Pairing

A pairing exercise where participants are not allowed to speak, encouraging reliance on non-verbal cues and attentive observation. This activity enhances communication skills and mutual understanding.

### Test-First Pairing

A practice where one partner writes a test that intentionally fails, and the other writes code to pass it. This is a form of Test-Driven Development (TDD), encouraging rigorous, quality-focused development.

### Coding Dojo

A collaborative programming session where participants practice solving coding challenges in a friendly environment, often focusing on a "kata." It helps improve skills in a low-pressure setting.

### Kata

A programming exercise, often repetitive, designed to improve skill and problem-solving techniques. Commonly used in coding dojos, it builds muscle memory for solving coding problems.

### Fizz Buzz (exercise)

A common programming task where developers write a program that prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both. It tests basic programming skills and logic.

### Baby Steps

A strategy where small, incremental changes are made to code to maintain control and ensure steady progress. This helps prevent overwhelm and allows for frequent feedback.

### YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)

A principle in agile software development that encourages avoiding unnecessary features. YAGNI helps teams focus on essential tasks to improve productivity.

### Styleguide

A set of coding standards that defines how code should be written and organized. Adhering to a style guide ensures consistency and readability within a team or project.

[wp: coding conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions)

### Regular Commits

The practice of committing code changes frequently to ensure incremental progress and reduce the risk of lost work. Regular commits make it easier to track changes and troubleshoot issues.
