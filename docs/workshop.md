# Pair Programming Workshop

The pairing workshop aims to teach the nuts, bolts and caveats of pair programming. A team will interact to get a grip of the following contents and concepts.

# Day 1: Theory

Duration: 12 Slots a 30 Minutes including breaks = 6 hours

## Introduction

> Introduce the Workshop format, rules and let the participants set personal learning goals for the two days. 

* Duration: 25 Minutes

### Contents

* Explain Training from Back of the Room training style
* Attendees brainstorming learning goals. 
* Speaker 
* Topic
* Rules
 * Law of 2 feet

## The Theory

> 25 Minute frontal opener for the topic

* What is pair programming
 * A little history
* Pairing formats, an overview
 * Pair Programming
 * Dojos
 * Katas

### Materials

* Post-Its
* Edding Markers

## Pair Draw 

> A simulation of pair programming, designed to give programmers (and whoever else is curious) a feel for what pair programming is like, before they actually try it.

* Duration 25 Minutes
* [Par Draw Game Rules](http://www.industriallogic.com/games/pairdraw.html)

### Materials

* Pens in different colors
* sheets of Paper
* A place to stick the resulting drawings for review

## Skill-levels of programmers

> It is known that, when we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of shu, ha, and ri. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to the forms with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws._

* Explain the Shu, Ha, Ri concept of skill development
  * [Shu-Har-Ri Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_ha_ri)
* Everyone does a self-rating of his own skill-level
* Outline the different skill combinations
  * Shu-Shu, Ha-Ha, Ri-Ri, Shu-Ha, Shu-Ri, Ha-Shu, Ha-Ri
* Let everyone brainstorm about the specialities of these combinations
* Discuss
* Fill what was is missing
* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its: Meeting Notes (Large)
* Post-Its
* Edding Markers


## Extraverts and Introverts

> The trait of extraversion-introversion is a central dimension of human personality theories. In Western popular usage, Extraverts (also spelled extroverts[1]) are thought to be gregarious, assertive, and interested in seeking out external stimulus. Introverts, in contrast, are seen as introspective, quiet and less sociable. They are not necessarily loners but they tend to have a smaller number of friends. Introversion does not describe social discomfort but rather social preference: an introvert may not be shy but may merely prefer fewer social activities.

* Review the results of the MBTI test
* Explain the MBTI test
* Let everybody decide for himself how much of an extra-/introvert she/he is
* Discuss the possible combinations
  * extra-extra, extra-intro, intro-intro
* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its: Meeting Notes (Large)
* Post-Its
* Edding Markers
* [MBTI - Description on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)
* [Test at humanmetrics.com](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp)
  * Read the description by J. Butt and M.M. Heiss
  * Decide if you are more introvert or extravert


## 7 Synergies of Pair Programming 

> When working as a pair there are 7 types of synergies that start influencing the outcome of the work. These are defined in "Pair Programming Illuminated"

* Duration 25 Minutes
* Synergies: Pair Pressure, Pair Negotiation, Pair Courage, Pair Reviews, Pair Debugging, Pair Learning, Pair Trust
* Activity: Draw a doodle and explain it

### Materials

* Post-Its: meeting Notes (Large)
* Whiteboard
* Whiteboard Markers


## Seven habits of effective Pair Programmers

> There is a set of habits that strongly support good results from Pair Programming. Knowing these habits can help participants see how to make pairing work better. The "Seven habits of effective Pair Programmers" are taken from "Pair Programming Illuminated".

* Activity: Participants are asked to brainstorm possible good habits before the ones from the book are presented and after putting them to a whiteboard they get clustered to the 7 habits
* Habits: take breaks, practice humility, be confident/receptive, communicate, listen, be a team player, balance between compromise and standing firm
* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials
 
* Post-Its
* Post-Its Meeting Notes (large) - 7 with the 7 habit
* Edding Markers
* White Board


## The myth or fact game of Pair Programming

> The "Myth or Fact" game tries to put the learned theory a bit more into practice by playing a little game where certain sentences are presented and the teams need to judge if they are a Myth or a Fact. The Goal is to store the theory learned into longterm memory.

### Rules


* Split into Teams up to 5 People
* Read the statement and decide if it is a myth or a fact
* One Team argues if the presented statement  is a Myth or a Fact
  * If the Answer is right: One point is awarded
* The next team can present another (different) answer
  * If the Answer is right: 2 points are awarded
* The start position switches to the next Team
* The Team with the most points wins
* Playtime 25 Minutes

### Material

* Beamer
* Slides of the [Pairing Myth or Fact Game](https://github.com/sebs/journeymans/tree/master/slides/pairingmythfact)

## Build Pairing-workspaces

> Building the workspaces used for pairing in order to examine the various possibilities in setups and the material at hand. The participants pick their hardware and set it up in different ways. 

* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials

(For 10 Participants)

* 5-10 24 inch Displays
* 5 Laptops/Computers
* Docking Stations
* 5 Tables 
* Network Cables
* Switches/Network
* 5-10 Keyboards
* 5-10 Mice

## Pairing I 

> The Team will engage in promiscuous pairing and make switches after 5 Minutes to experience the changes of driver and navigator. This works like the first round in a Board game where rules are tested by playing with all cards open.

* Duration: 50 Minutes
* Each pair chooses the topic they will work on 
* Switches all 5 Minutes
* After 2 Switches: Change of Pairs

* Duration 25 Minutes
* Activity: Write down up to open 3 questions in 3 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its
* Edding Markers
* List of Goals

# Day 2. Pairing Practice

> The second day aims to put theory in practice and thereby engage all the participants in Pair-programming.

* Duration 25 Minutes


## Materials
* Beamer
* List of goals
* Slides
* Collection of Tasks/Stories

## Pairing II

* Switch after 10 minutes
* Stopwatch used by instructor/coach
* everyone switches
* A Point is awarded when a commit is done

## Closing

> The participants speak out their observations of what happened. The goal i that everyone grabbed the difference between hinge-, promiscuous- and test-first-pairing. Everyone should be informed now that there is a reason for regular switches of driver/navigator and walking the path of least resistance (let the better  once code) is not helping at all. 

* Duration 25 Minutes
