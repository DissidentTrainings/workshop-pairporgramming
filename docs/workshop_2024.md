## Pair Draw 

> A simulation of pair programming, designed to give programmers (and whoever else is curious) a feel for what pair programming is like, before they actually try it.

PairDraw is a simulation of pair programming, designed to give programmers and managers (and whoever else is curious) a feel for what pair programming is like, before they actually try it.
We use PairDraw in The eXtreme Programming Workshop and you can use it to help introduce pair programming to people in your organization.

* Duration 25 Minutes

### The Simulation 
 
It's easy to conduct this simulation. Schedule 20-30 minutes with a group of participants and make sure you have an even number of participants for pairing. Professional simulation designers suggest spending one-third of your time doing a simulation and two-thirds debriefing it.
You will need a ream of blank white paper and one color magic marker for every participant. It is best to use a good selection of colored markers, so each participant can have a unique color. Before beginning, let each participant choose a magic marker and give each participant 2 pieces of blank white paper.

Now, tell the participants they have 2 minutes to draw two faces: 1 face on one white sheet and another face on another white sheet. Everyone will draw these faces by themselves using their magic marker.

As soon as everyone has completed this task (or when 2 minutes is up), ask everyone to form pairs. It helps if participants pair with people they aren't best friends with, but you can let participants decide with whom to pair.

Once the pairs have formed, have each pair find a comfortable place where they will be able to draw together. Each pair should have 2 different color magic markers: So if Jon and Jane pair, they can't both have blue markers. Pairs should use colors that are different in hue (not green and light green) so that it will easy to see which participant contributed what to each drawing.

Give each pair 2 sheets of blank white paper (or you can have them all work on a white board) and ask them to PairDraw a human face (one face per sheet of paper).

When every pair has completed drawing 2 human faces, the entire group can assemble for the debrief.

### Materials

* Pens in different colors
* sheets of Paper
* A place to stick the resulting drawings for review
* Scotch Tape to pin the results to a wall or board

## Skill-levels of programmers

Programmers have different Skill levels and pairing up 2 persons will result in one kind of skill gap or another. These skill gaps are one of the main drivers, why working in pairs is so effective, but every combination of skill levels has its own qualities. 


> It is known that, when we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of shu, ha, and ri. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to the forms with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, more unhindered by laws/rules.._

* Explain the Shu, Ha, Ri concept of skill development
  * [Shu-Har-Ri Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_ha_ri)
* Everyone does a self-rating of his own skill-level
* Outline the different skill combinations
  * Shu-Shu, Ha-Ha, Ri-Ri, Shu-Ha, Shu-Ri, Ha-Shu, Ha-Ri
* Let everyone brainstorm about the specialities of these combinations
* Discuss
* Fill what was is missing
* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its: Meeting Notes (Large)
* Post-Its

## Extraverts and Introverts

> The trait of extraversion-introversion is a central dimension of human personality theories. In Western popular usage, Extraverts (also spelled extroverts[1]) are thought to be gregarious, assertive, and interested in seeking out external stimulus. Introverts, in contrast, are seen as introspective, quiet and less sociable. They are not necessarily loners but they tend to have a smaller number of friends. Introversion does not describe social discomfort but rather social preference: an introvert may not be shy but may merely prefer fewer social activities.

* Introduction of Intro- and Extraversions
* Let everybody decide for himself how much of an extra-/introvert she/he is
* Discuss the possible combinations
  * extra-extra, extra-intro, intro-intro
* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its: Meeting Notes (Large)
* Post-Its
* Edding Markers

## Synergies of Pair Programming 

> When working as a pair there are synergies that start influencing the outcome of the work. These are defined in "Pair Programming Illuminated".

This exercise lets teams analyse their own personal traits and preferences and find ways to use them to the benefit of pari programming sessions,

* Duration 25 Minutes
* Synergies: Pair Pressure, Pair Negotiation, Pair Courage, Pair Reviews, Pair Debugging, Pair Learning, Pair Trust
* Activity: Draw a doodle and explain it

### Materials

* Post-Its: meeting Notes (Large)
* Whiteboard
* Whiteboard Markers

## Seven habits of effective Pair Programmers

Working more closely as a team leads to more social interaction. In order to create an atmosphere helpful for the endeavour of creating high quality software, a list of habits has emerged usable as a guideline to support the daily interaction on the code.

> There is a set of habits that strongly support good results from Pair Programming. Knowing these habits can help participants see how to make pairing work better. The "Seven habits of effective Pair Programmers" are taken from "Pair Programming Illuminated".

* Activity: Participants are asked to brainstorm possible good habits before the ones from the book are presented and after putting them to a whiteboard they get clustered to the 7 habits
* 'Original' Habits: take breaks, practice humility, be confident/receptive, communicate, listen, be a team player, balance between compromise and standing firm
* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials
 
* Post-Its
* Post-Its Meeting Notes (large) - 7 with the 7 habits
* Edding Markers
* White Board

## The myth or fact game of Pair Programming

> The "Myth or Fact" game tries to put the learned theory a bit more into practice by playing a little game where certain sentences are presented and the teams need to judge if they are a Myth or a Fact. The Goal is to store the theory learned into longterm memory.

### Rules

* Split into Teams up to 5 People
* Read the statement and decide if it is a myth or a fact
* One Team argues if the presented statement  is a Myth or a Fact
  * If the Answer is right: One point is awarded
* The next team can present another (different) answer
  * If the Answer is right: 2 points are awarded
* The start position switches to the next Team
* The Team with the most points wins
* Playtime 25 Minutes

### Material

* Beamer
* Slides of the [Pairing Myth or Fact Game](https://github.com/sebs/journeymans/tree/master/slides/pairingmythfact)

## Build Pairing-workspaces

> Building the workspaces used for pairing in order to examine the various possibilities in setups and the material at hand. The participants pick their hardware and set it up in different ways. 

* Duration 25 Minutes

* Network Cables
* Switches/Network
* 5-10 Keyboards
* 5-10 Mice

## Pairing I 

> The Team will engage in promiscuous pairing and make switches after 5 Minutes to experience the changes of driver and navigator. This works like the first round in a Board game where rules are tested by playing with all cards open.

* Duration: 50 Minutes
* Each pair chooses the topic they will work on 
* Switches all 5 Minutes
* After 2 Switches: Change of Pairs
* Maintain a "Pairing-Stair"
* As change as much as you can
* 10 Minutes break afterwards

### Materials

* Post-Its
* Edding Marker 
* Pair Stair
* Whiteboard
* Pairing-workspaces
* Stop Watch 

## Feedback and Questions 

> Feedback and closing activity for Part 1. Participants write down 3 open questions regarding Pair-programming and rate how much of the goals they set in the opening are already fulfilled.

* Duration 25 Minutes
* Activity: Write down up to open 3 questions in 3 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its
* Edding Markers
* List of Goals

# Day 2. Pairing Practice

> The second day aims to put theory in practice and thereby engage all the participants in Pair-programming.

### Goals

* Explain and explore different modes of Pair-programming
* Explore different ways of fining a pairing-partner
* Find out more requirements from the team
  * Switch times
  * Setups
* Explore the effects of knowledge sharing in pairing 
* Explore remote pairing

12 Slots = 6 Hrs

## Opening Day 2

> Presenting the second Part of the Pairing Methods and explaining the Goals of the day. Additionally the discussion about forced switches and switch-times is started. Pairing will be done on real life tasks and commits is the thing we aim for from now on. 

* Duration 25 Minutes

## Materials

* Beamer
* List of goals
* Slides
* Collection of Tasks/Stories

## The economics of pairing

Reasons why pairing has a net positive economic side are the focus of this session. 

> There is a reason pairprogramming works out well for teams and 'investing twice the work into what one person could have built' is far from the truth here. There are several effects that makes pairing economically feasable.

* Duration 25 Minutes

### Materials

* Post-Its
* Edding Markers
* List of Goals

## Pairing II - Retreat

> This round of pairing will be done on real-life tasks or kata exercises and aims at a more realistic switch time of driver/navigator. The main goal is to prove that little steps can drive a project forward. 

* Duration 125 Minutes (3 Slots)
* Stopwatch used by instructor/coach
* Have a pair stair tpo track who paired with whom
* Agree a timeframe to switch
* In regular intervals, make sure breaks are taken and switch time is reviewed
* Feedback in the end of the exercise (10-15 minutes)

### Possible Constraints

* Silent Pairing: No talking for 15 Minutes with Switches all 3 Minutes
* Ping-Pong: One pair partner writes the test (Test-First code!), the other implements the code to make the test pass. With this pattern, with one partner may write all the tests, or the partners may take turns.
* Mute Ping-Pong: Similar as Ping-Pong, but one partner will only be writing tests, and the other will be only writing the code to make the test pass. The pair may not to discuss or communicate about the problem in any way other than through the code (no comments, etc.: Follow the intent!)
* Ensemble: Group of three or more people, with Driver and Navigator roles rotating. Partners who are not Driver or Navigator suggest problem strategies and answer questions from Navigator.

### Closing

> The participants speak out their observations of what happened. These are collected

### Materials 

* Post-Its
